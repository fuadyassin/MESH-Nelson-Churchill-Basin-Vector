ncatted: ERROR file /scratch/fuaday/ncrb-models/easymore-outputs-merged/ncrb_rdrs_1982_1986_v21_allVar2.nc not found. It does not exist on the local filesystem, nor does it match remote filename patterns (e.g., http://foo or foo.bar.edu:file).
ncatted: HINT file-not-found errors usually arise from filename typos, incorrect paths, missing files, or capricious gods. Please verify spelling and location of requested file. If the file resides on a High Performance Storage System (HPSS) accessible via the 'hsi' command, then add the --hpss option and re-try command.
